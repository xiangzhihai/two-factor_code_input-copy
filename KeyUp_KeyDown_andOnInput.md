# Key Event Sequence for Input Fields in React

When handling key events in input fields in React, it's essential to understand the order in which events are triggered. Here’s a breakdown of the sequence:

1. **`onKeyDown`**: 
   - Triggered as soon as a key is pressed down.
   - Happens **before** the input field's value is updated.
   - Useful for detecting the start of a key press, before the input’s value changes.

2. **`onInput`**:
   - Fires after the input field's value has changed.
   - This event occurs whether the value is modified by typing, pasting, or other input methods.
   - Ideal for handling real-time changes to the input’s content.

3. **`onKeyUp`**:
   - Triggered when the key is released.
   - Occurs **after** the input field’s value has already been updated.
   - Useful for finalizing actions once the key press is complete.

## Example Timeline for a Key Press

If a user types a character (e.g., "A"), the event order is as follows:

1. `onKeyDown` fires when the "A" key is pressed down.
2. `onInput` fires after the input value is updated to "A".
3. `onKeyUp` fires when the "A" key is released.

## Key Takeaway

- **`onKeyDown`** happens first, before the input’s value is changed.
- **`onInput`** happens after the input value is changed.
- **`onKeyUp`** happens last, after the key is released.

Understanding this order helps in choosing the right event for the desired interaction:
- Use `onKeyDown` for actions before the value changes.
- Use `onInput` for real-time content changes.
- Use `onKeyUp` for final actions once the key press cycle is complete.
