# Handling `Backspace` in Sequential Inputs with `onKeyDown` and `onKeyUp` Events in React

When working with sequential input fields (e.g., one-time passcodes or multi-digit forms), handling the `Backspace` key can lead to unexpected behaviors. Specifically, using `onKeyDown` to manage `Backspace` and then shifting focus programmatically can result in unintended behavior. This knowledge point explores why this occurs and how switching to `onKeyUp` can solve the issue.

## The Issue with `onKeyDown` and Programmatic Focus Shift

### Scenario
Imagine a sequence of single-character input fields where each field shifts focus to the next once a digit is entered. If the user presses `Backspace` in one field, the focus should ideally move back to the previous field.

### Problem with `onKeyDown`
When using `onKeyDown` to detect `Backspace`:
1. The `Backspace` action is detected, and focus is programmatically shifted to the previous input.
2. However, `Backspace` can sometimes carry over to the newly focused field, causing it to unexpectedly delete its value. This is because `onKeyDown` fires before the DOM processes the full key action.

### Why the "Carry-Over" Happens
When `Backspace` is pressed:
- The `onKeyDown` event fires as soon as the key is pressed, even before the key is released.
- If focus is moved to a previous input while `Backspace` is still being processed, the browser recognizes `Backspace` as still active, potentially clearing the value in the newly focused field as well.
- Additionally, the previous input does not re-trigger `onKeyDown` because the key press event originated in the initial input.

## Solution: Using `onKeyUp`

Switching from `onKeyDown` to `onKeyUp` solves this issue:
1. **Event Sequence**: `onKeyUp` fires only after the key has been fully pressed and released, completing the key's lifecycle.
2. **Focus Stability**: By the time `onKeyUp` fires, `Backspace` is no longer active, so when focus is shifted programmatically, the newly focused field isn’t impacted by a lingering `Backspace` event.

### Key Takeaways
- **`onKeyDown`** can cause unintended carry-over of the `Backspace` key action when focus is shifted programmatically.
- **`onKeyUp`** waits until the `Backspace` key action completes, preventing accidental deletions in newly focused fields.

## Example Solution

Here’s a code example that illustrates using `onKeyUp` instead of `onKeyDown` to manage focus shifts:

```tsx
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function SequentialInput() {
  const [input1, setInput1] = useState('');
  const [input2, setInput2] = useState('');
  const inputRef1 = useRef<HTMLInputElement | null>(null);
  const inputRef2 = useRef<HTMLInputElement | null>(null);

  const handleKeyUp = (
    event: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>,
    setCurrentValue: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string>>,
    prevRef: React.RefObject<HTMLInputElement>
  ) => {
    if (event.key === 'Backspace') {
      setCurrentValue(''); // Clear the current input
      prevRef.current?.focus(); // Shift focus to the previous input
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        ref={inputRef1}
        value={input1}
        onChange={(e) => setInput1(e.target.value)}
        onKeyUp={(e) => handleKeyUp(e, setInput1, inputRef1)}
      />
      <input
        ref={inputRef2}
        value={input2}
        onChange={(e) => setInput2(e.target.value)}
        onKeyUp={(e) => handleKeyUp(e, setInput2, inputRef1)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

By using `onKeyUp` instead of `onKeyDown`, the `Backspace` key action completes before shifting focus, avoiding the issue of unintended deletions in the previous input field.

## Conclusion

When handling sequential inputs in React, use `onKeyUp` rather than `onKeyDown` for `Backspace` key management. This approach ensures that focus shifts do not inadvertently carry over the `Backspace` action, creating a smoother user experience.
